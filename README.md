# How to Contribute

### 0. Star the RepositoryðŸŒŸ
- To star the repository, simply click on the "Star" button at the top-right corner of this page.ðŸ™Œ

### 1. Fork the Repository

- Click on the "Fork" button on the top right corner of this repository's page. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the forked repository to your local machine. Open your terminal/command prompt and use the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arjunpndt/Hacktoberfest.git
```

### 3. Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your contributions.
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```


### 4. Make Your Contributions

- <b>Code</b>: If you're up for contributing code or algorithms, simply place them in the 'Code' folder. If you have a different project or any other topic in mind, create a dedicated folder for it outside of 'Code' like a 'Snake-Game' folder. Use a language you're comfortable with, and let your creativity flow!
- <b>Add Your Name</b>: If you're new to coding or just want to participate in a simple way, you can add your name to the contributors.md file using the following format:
```markdown
[YOUR NAME](https://github.com/your-username)
```

### 5. Commit and Push

Once you've made your changes, commit them with a descriptive message. Then, push the changes to your forked repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
git push origin main
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request(PR)

- Go to the original repository (not your forked version).
- Click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
- Click on the "New Pull Request" button.
- Select your forked repository as the base branch and submit the pull request.

**All done!** ðŸŽ‰ Now, sit back, relax, and grab your favorite snack. Your pull request will be merged as soon as possibleðŸŒŒ. 
To ensure the pull request gets a turbo boost of approval (`Hit that 'Follow' button from my profile`) ðŸš€
